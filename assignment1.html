    <h2><u>About me</u></h2>
    <p>I am Nisha Jasmin C, a driven BCA graduate from the University of Calicut, where I proudly secured the 4th rank in the university in 2024. 
        With a strong foundation in software development, I bring hands-on experience in building dynamic and responsive web applications using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and PHP. 
        My academic journey is enriched by impactful projects, including a university website and the GreenPad Online Portal, promoting sustainability through banana fiber sanitary pad sales.
        I have also earned certifications in data visualization using AI and data insights with Excel, along with completing a work readiness program by ASAP Kerala.
        Known for my problem-solving ability, teamwork, and communication skills, I stand out through a unique combination of technical knowledge, 
        academic excellence, and a deep commitment to using technology for meaningful, real-world impact.</p>
